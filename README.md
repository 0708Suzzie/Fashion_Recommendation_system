Fashion Recommender System

The concepts majorly used here are CNN and K-NearestNeighbors :

I learnt about CNN from here : https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53


I learnt about KNN from multiple sources but here are the top 2 : https://www.javatpoint.com/k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm-for-machine-learning

https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761

we have multiple ways to find distances here , we chose euclidean.

there are other methods for classification as well such as approximate nearest neighbors which we could've used using annoy though I am sticking with sklearn's NearestNeighbour here for now.


The data set has been picked up from kaggle :

Images in the sample folder have been taken from random sources and they are not mine 

I followed the following tutorial to build the webapp :

I specifically used python 3.7 with tensorflow 2.3.1 as they work well together
